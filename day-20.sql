-- Title: Hot Cocoa Break Logs
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

select c.log_id, c.break_id, co.cocoa_name, l.location_name from 
cocoa_logs c
join break_schedule b
on c.break_id = b.break_id
join cocoa_types co
on c.cocoa_id = co.cocoa_id
join locations l 
on b.location_id = l.location_id
